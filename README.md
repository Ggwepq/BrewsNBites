## About BrewsNBites

BrewsNBites is a Ecommerce web application that sells coffee, desserts, and foods for the users. It uses Laravel as the main development framework with Vue.js & Inertia.js for the frontend. BrewsNBites takes inspiration for its product from a cafe site [Coffee Project](https://coffeeproject.com.ph/). We are very greatful for the Coffee Project website as it have many products which we take as an example for this project of ours. We custom made the logo for the site and for the products as well. Same goes with the website layout and design. We believe that just copying and watching from a tutorial won't give us most of the knowledge that's why we take it as a challenge to customized the website for our preference and for the theme of the project.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
